# Prompt Log

This file records substantial AI/agent prompts and outcomes for the OASIS home
repository.

Use it as lightweight working memory for future maintenance, especially when a
task establishes new conventions, updates repo process, or changes multiple
homepage sections.

- Goal: Create a repository-specific `AGENTS.md` and establish a reusable prompt
  log format grounded in the actual OASIS repo rather than generic agent rules.
- Context reviewed: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `mkdocs.yml`,
  `docs/dev/oasis-site-dev-guide.md`, `docs/index.md`, representative
  quickstart/resource/container docs, generated-content scripts
  (`scripts/check_front_matter.py`, `scripts/generate_tags.py`,
  `scripts/update_dev_schedule.py`), Playwright tests, GitHub workflows,
  schedule docs, style/override files, and submodule configuration.
- Files changed: `AGENTS.md`, `PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Validation: Cross-checked the new guidance against repo workflows, build/test
  config, homepage layout constraints, generated tag behavior, schedule update
  process, and existing contributor docs.
- Follow-up / unresolved: `AGENTS.md` recommends substantial-work logging in
  this file going forward; future agents should append entries rather than
  rewriting prior ones.

## 2026-04-21

- Goal: Refine the repository mission statement in `AGENTS.md` to reflect that
  this is the central repository for ESIIL activities, paired with a network
  portal for deploying resources and a data store for large data.
- Context reviewed: Existing `AGENTS.md` mission/role language and the user’s
  clarification about the broader ESIIL platform model.
- Files changed: `AGENTS.md`, `PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Validation: Confirmed the updated wording still aligns with the rest of the
  repo-specific guidance and strengthens the explanation of how this repo fits
  into the larger ESIIL ecosystem.
- Follow-up / unresolved: If desired, the same ecosystem framing could also be
  added to `README.md` for human contributors.
