# Analytics Library

## Sell It
The Analytics Library hosts reusable workflows and functions so you can build
analyses faster and with consistent methods. Each entry is tested and
documented, saving you from reinventing common analysis steps.

## Show It
Each workflow page includes step-by-step instructions and example outputs at
the [Analytics Library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/analytics-library/). Many provide
Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the functions.

## Do It
1. **Browse the catalog.** Visit the library and search for a workflow that fits
   your project.
2. **Read the documentation.** Open the workflow's README to learn about
   required inputs and dependencies.
3. **Clone or download.** Get the workflow code onto your machine.
4. **Install dependencies.** Use the instructions in the README to install
   required packages or container images.
5. **Run the workflow.** Execute it on the provided sample data before applying
   it to your own dataset.

## Review It
Compare your results to the example outputs and note any differences. If you
improve the workflow or create a new one, consider contributing it back to the
library for others to use.
