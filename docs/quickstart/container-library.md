# Container Image Library

## Sell It
Pre-built container images give you ready-to-run environments without installing software on your machine.

## Show It
The [Container Image Library](../container-library/index.md) lists images with descriptions and tags; pull one with Docker to see a fully configured environment.

## Do It
1. Browse the library to choose an image.
2. Use `docker pull <image>` to download it.
3. Run it with `docker run -it <image> /bin/bash`.

## Review It
Check the tools inside the container and note which images fit your workflow for future projects.
