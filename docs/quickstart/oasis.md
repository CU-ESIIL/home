# Starting with OASIS

## Sell It
OASIS is ESIIL's platform for open science workflows, linking datasets, code, and computing resources in one place.

## Show It
A typical OASIS project combines documentation and runnable notebooks to share reproducible research.

## Do It
1. Visit the [OASIS homepage](../index.md) and sign in.
2. Create a new project or explore an existing one.
3. Launch an analysis notebook to see how data and code connect.

## Review It
Verify that you can open and run the sample notebook, and consider how OASIS can host your own project.
