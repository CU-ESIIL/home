# Starting with OASIS

## Sell It
OASIS is ESIIL's platform for open science workflows. It links datasets, code,
and computing resources in one place so you can move from idea to analysis
without juggling multiple tools. Projects live online, making it easy to share
reproducible research with collaborators or the public.

## Show It
A typical OASIS project combines documentation and runnable notebooks. The web
interface lets you view narratives, launch Jupyter notebooks, and track
datasets, all within a single project dashboard.

## Do It
1. **Sign in.** Visit the [OASIS homepage](../index.md) and log in with your
   credentials.
2. **Create a project.** Click *New Project*, give it a descriptive name, and
   add a short description.
3. **Explore the workspace.** Open the project and launch an analysis notebook
   to see how data and code connect.
4. **Add data.** Upload a file or link a dataset from the Data Library.
5. **Share it.** Invite collaborators or publish the project when you're ready.

## Review It
Verify that you can open and run the sample notebook. Review the project
dashboard and note how OASIS keeps your code, data, and documentation together
for future work.
