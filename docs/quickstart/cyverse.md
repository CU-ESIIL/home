# Starting with CyVerse

## Sell It
CyVerse provides free cloud storage and powerful computing so you can scale
analyses without managing local infrastructure. It is built for researchers and
offers a long-term home for data and reproducible workflows.

## Show It
The CyVerse Discovery Environment offers a web workspace where you can upload
data, launch apps, and monitor jobsâ€”all from a browser.

## Do It
1. **Create an account.** Register for free at
   [cyverse.org](https://www.cyverse.org/).
2. **Log in.** Access the Discovery Environment and familiarize yourself with
   the data browser.
3. **Upload data.** Use the *Upload* button to add a small file or pick a sample
   dataset.
4. **Run an app.** Choose a simple app such as *FastQC* or *JupyterLab* and
   launch it using your dataset.

## Review It
Confirm your files appear in your account and check the job history for the app
you ran. Browse the list of available apps to plan how CyVerse can support your
next analysis.
