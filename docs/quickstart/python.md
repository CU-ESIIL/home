## 1. Opening the Lab Together: Startup Procedure

Before we can explore, we need to get into the cloud.

Follow the [OASIS QuickStart: Cloud Triangle](https://cu-esiil.github.io/home/quickstart/cloud/) instructions:

- Log in to ACCESS-CI.  
- Launch your JupyterHub instance.  
- Confirm the Triangle is running.  
- Open a terminal and check that `gocmd` is available:

```bash
gocmd --help
```
