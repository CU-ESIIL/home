# Starting with Python

## Sell It
Python is a flexible language with a rich ecosystem of libraries for data science and automation.

## Show It
A minimal script prints a message:

```python
print("Hello, OASIS!")
```

## Do It
1. Install Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/).
2. Create an environment with `conda create -n myenv python` or `python -m venv myenv`.
3. Activate the environment and run `python` to enter the interpreter.
4. Execute the script above to verify it works.

## Review It
Run `python --version` and ensure the environment isolates packages for your project.
