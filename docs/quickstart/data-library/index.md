# Data Library

## Sell It
The Data Library is ESIIL's central hub for sharing vetted datasets so you can
start analyzing immediately. Each dataset includes rich metadata, provenance,
and ready-to-use code snippets.

## Show It
Visit a dataset page to see descriptive metadata, citation information, and
copy-and-paste code snippets, like on the
[library homepage](https://cu-esiil.github.io/library/data/).

## Do It
1. **Head to the site.** Open the
   [Data Library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/library/data/).
2. **Search or browse.** Use search or tags to find a dataset relevant to your
   question.
3. **Read the metadata.** Review the description, license, and code snippets.
4. **Download and explore.** Follow the dataset's instructions or linked
   tutorials to load it into your environment.

## Review It
Reflect on how the dataset fits your project and explore the guides:
- [How to Use the Data Library](how-to-use.md)
- [How to Contribute to the Data Library](how-to-contribute.md)
Consider noting any data quality issues or additional metadata that would help
future users.
