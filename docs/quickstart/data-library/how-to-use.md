# How to Use the Data Library

## Sell It
The Data Library lets you discover curated datasets maintained by ESIIL, saving
time on searching and cleaning data. Each entry includes context and code
snippets so you can load the data immediately.

## Show It
Each dataset page includes rich metadata and code snippets for R or Python to
load the data directly. You can preview files and see how others have used the
dataset.

## Do It
1. **Navigate to the site.** Go to the
   [Data Library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/library/data/).
2. **Browse or search.** Look for a dataset that matches your project goals.
3. **Open the dataset page.** Read the description and preview any available
   files.
4. **Copy the code snippet.** Use the R or Python snippet to download the data
   into your environment.
5. **Explore the data.** Follow the example usage or start your own analysis.

## Review It
Check that the dataset loads correctly in your session and note any questions or
improvements to share with the community. Bookmark the dataset page and cite it
in your work to give credit to the data providers.
