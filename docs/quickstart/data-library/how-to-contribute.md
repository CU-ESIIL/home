# How to Contribute to the Data Library

## Sell It
Sharing datasets expands the community's resources and promotes reproducible
research. Contributing to the Data Library makes your data discoverable and
citable by others.

## Show It
The Data Library repository uses GitHub pull requests so contributions are
transparent and trackable. Templates guide you through adding metadata and
example code.

## Do It
1. **Visit the repository.** Go to the
   [Data Library repository](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/data-library) and fork
   it to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork.** Create a new branch for your dataset.
3. **Add data and metadata.** Follow the contribution guidelines and naming
   conventions when adding files.
4. **Commit and push.** Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
5. **Open a pull request.** Describe your dataset and link any relevant
   documentation.

## Review It
Link your pull request in an issue or discussion and watch for feedback from
maintainers. Respond to review comments and, once merged, share the published
dataset page with your community.
