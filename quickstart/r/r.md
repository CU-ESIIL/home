# Starting with R

## Sell It
R is a powerful language for statistics and visualization with an active
community. Packages like **tidyverse** make data wrangling intuitive, and the
language was designed with data analysis in mind from the start.

## Show It
An example script plots a built-in dataset to produce an immediate
visualization:

```r
plot(cars)
```

## Do It
1. **Install R.** Download the latest version from the
   [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/).
2. **Install RStudio.** Get the free
   [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) IDE for a
   user-friendly interface.
3. **Open RStudio.** Create a new script file and paste in the example above.
4. **Install a package.** Run `install.packages("tidyverse")` to add common
   tools for data science.
5. **Run the script.** Highlight the code and click *Run* or press `Ctrl+Enter`
   to generate the plot.

## Review It
Confirm the plot appears in the **Plots** pane and use `sessionInfo()` to see
package versions. Explore the **Environment** and **Help** tabs to get
comfortable with the interface.
